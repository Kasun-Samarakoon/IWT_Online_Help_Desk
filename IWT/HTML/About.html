    <h1><center>About</center></h1>
	<p>
	The digital technology world has experienced a paradigm shift in terms of connectivity and collaboration capabilities over the last few decades. 
	This change has sparked a phenomenal evolution of ecosystems in higher education around the world.
	Universities around the world have leveraged digital transformation to reshape the way educational content is provided to their students, 
	from blackboards to interactive screens and smart classrooms.
	Educational technology advances, such as vast open online courses, VR labs, remote learning platforms, virtual reality, 
	IoT, and developing your own computer policies, have created a more productive on-campus and off-campus learning environment.</p>
	
	<p>As well as in virtually every professional position in every sector today, technical skills are a requirement. 
	Helping students learn to engage with technical systems such as those used by educational institutions means training them to access
	the tools offered as a textbook for the user, not requiring them to memorize particular activities.Students can only learn to use a manual, 
	of course, if it has open data that solves their problems.</p>
	
	<p>Users can access these support pages, search by topic, and follow up on questions about their particular situation that represent 
	a deeper contextual understanding of the problem they are facing, and also learn to solve minor problems on their own.
	This benefits students, but it also benefits workers, so it is easy to spread the training process to use the latest program, with centered 
	training to implement system basics and a good learning support manual to understand the finer features of the software as it is incorporated 
	into the other educational technology resources.</p>
	
	<p>So, This site represents an online help desk for university students. 
	This site allows students to choose the course that best suits has their professional qualification. 
	Therefor this site is helpful for students to choose the university for your choice and the course. 
	Not only that students can ask the questions regarding selected course and student can solve their questions through this site and, 
	they can contact the lectures get the further details about their questions. Here Students can refer e-books which lectures mention, 
	through e-library. not only they refer them online. If they want to download them, they can download relevant e-book by a payment.
